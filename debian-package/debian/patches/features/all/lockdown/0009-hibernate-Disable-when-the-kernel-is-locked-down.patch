Subject: [PATCH 09/27] hibernate: Disable when the kernel is locked down

There is currently no way to verify the resume image when returning
from hibernate.  This might compromise the signed modules trust model,
so until we can work with signed hibernate images we disable it when the
kernel is locked down.
